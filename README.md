Solving Cart-Pole problem using Qlearning and DQN algorithms 

Project Overview: 
This project aims to solve the classic "Cart Pole" problem using reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and DQN. In this problem, there is a pole attached to a cart that is free to move along a frictionless track. The goal is to balance the pole on top of the cart by moving the cart left or right. The task is considered solved if the pole remains upright for a specified number of time steps.

Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* Pytorch
* Matplotlib
* Gym

Steps:
1. Install all the requirements
2. Clone the repository 
3. Run cartpole_q.py as - python cartpole_q.py
4. Run cartpole_dqn.py as  - python cartpole_dqn.py
5. We can see the cart pole being balanced in the rendering of the environment. 

Conclusion:
Both Q-learning and DQN were able to successfully solve the Cart Pole problem, with the DQN agent achieving better performance than the Q-learning agent.
